# tBTC Cross-Chain Relayer Implementation Progress

## Current Status

Implementation phase complete for the main relayer components. The SuiChainHandler and ETHVAASuiRelayer classes have been implemented to handle the cross-chain VAA message passing process. Environment variables support added for improved security.

## Completed

- Reviewed all relevant documentation (Sui Flow docs, Wormhole VAA relayer docs)
- Analyzed existing contracts (BitcoinDepositor.move)
- Analyzed L1 contract options (`L1BitcoinDepositorWormhole.sol`, `BTCDepositorWormhole.sol`)
- **Selected `BTCDepositorWormhole.sol` as the L1 contract.**
- Created detailed summary and sequence diagrams for VAA message passing (Revised for event-driven relayer VAA fetch/submit)
- Identified key configuration points and implementation needs (Updated for new L1 contract and flow)
- Updated Memory Bank files
- **Verified Gateway contract on Sui has the necessary `redeem_tokens` functionality**
- **Implemented SuiChainHandler with complete VAA submission functionality**
- **Implemented ETHVAASuiRelayer to listen for token bridge events and fetch/relay VAAs**
- **Created configuration templates and entry point script**
- **Added environment variables support with dotenv for improved security**

## Implementation Details

### Key Components Implemented

1. **SuiChainHandler.ts**

   - Handles deposit event monitoring on Sui
   - Provides VAA submission functionality with retry mechanism
   - Handles Sui transaction building and signing

2. **ETHVAASuiRelayer.ts**

   - Listens for `TokensTransferredWithPayload` events on Ethereum
   - Fetches VAAs from the Guardian API
   - Submits VAAs to Sui using SuiChainHandler
   - Includes retry mechanism with exponential backoff

3. **Configuration**

   - Created `config.example.json` with all necessary config parameters
   - Includes chain configs for both Ethereum and Sui
   - Includes Wormhole Token Bridge configuration

4. **Entry Point**
   - Created `vaa-relayer.ts` script to initialize and run the relayer
   - Handles configuration loading and validation
   - Implements proper shutdown hooks

## Next Steps

- Configure and deploy in a test environment
- Implement automated tests for the relayer components
- Add monitoring and alerting for production deployment

## Pending Issues

- Finalize the wrapped token type for the `receiveWormholeMessages` call
- Set up production-grade persistence for the VAA tracking
- Add detailed metrics and logging for production use

## Blockers

- None currently
