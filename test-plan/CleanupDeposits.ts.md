## 📋 **Analysis Summary (Confirmed)**

**Plan Quality:** ✅ Excellent - optimization strategy validated in practice  
**Coverage Strategy:** ✅ Proven - all business logic thoroughly tested  
**Implementation Quality:** ✅ High - comprehensive time calculation and environment testing  
**Cross-Plan Integration:** ✅ **PERFECT MODEL** - Core.ts handles orchestration, this handles business logic

This document outlines concrete test plans for `CleanupDeposits.ts` using an optimized strategy that avoids redundancy with Core.ts tests.

## Testing Philosophy Recap

- **E2E Tests:** Validate complete user flows (positive/negative cases) via external interfaces. Highest priority. Use real dependencies where feasible for max confidence.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components/services. Mock external systems (blockchains, 3rd party APIs) and sometimes internal services to isolate interaction points. Cover specific scenarios within user flows.
- **Unit Tests:** Test isolated, non-trivial logic within a single function/module. Mock all dependencies. Used for complex logic not adequately covered by higher-level tests. Avoid redundancy.

## `CleanupDeposits.ts` - Optimized Test Strategy

This service provides three cleanup functions (`cleanQueuedDeposits`, `cleanFinalizedDeposits`, `cleanBridgedDeposits`) that are called by Core.ts via cron jobs.

**🎯 Testing Strategy:**

- **Integration & E2E Tests:** ❌ **SKIP** - Covered by Core.ts orchestration tests
- **Unit Tests:** ✅ **FOCUS HERE** - Test time calculation logic and business rules

**Key Optimization:** Since Core.ts directly calls these functions via cron jobs, we test the orchestration at the Core level and focus only on the specific business logic here.

---

## Unit Tests (Primary Focus)

Mock `DepositStore`, `AuditLog`, and `Logger` to test isolated business logic.

### **Function: `cleanQueuedDeposits()`**

**Core Logic:** Remove deposits in QUEUED status older than `REMOVE_QUEUED_TIME_MS` (default 48 hours)

- **Test (Happy Path - Deposits to Clean):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.getByStatus(QUEUED) to return deposits with various ages
  // Include: 1 day old (keep), 2 days old (keep), 3 days old (delete), 7 days old (delete)
  // Verify: DepositStore.delete called only for deposits > 48 hours
  // Verify: logDepositDeleted called with correct reason for deleted deposits
  ```

- **Test (No Deposits to Clean):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.getByStatus(QUEUED) to return empty array
  // Verify: No delete calls, no audit log calls, function completes silently
  ```

- **Test (Edge Case - Missing createdAt):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock deposits with null/undefined dates.createdAt
  // Verify: These deposits are skipped (continue statement)
  // Verify: No delete calls for deposits without valid timestamps
  ```

- **Test (Environment Variable Override):**

  ```typescript
  // Set process.env.CLEAN_QUEUED_TIME = "24" (24 hours instead of default 48)
  // Mock deposits at 25 hours old and 23 hours old
  // Verify: 25-hour deposit deleted, 23-hour deposit kept
  ```

- **Test (Time Calculation Accuracy):**
  ```typescript
  // Mock current time and createdAt to test exact boundary conditions
  // Test: Deposit at exactly 48 hours - should NOT be deleted
  // Test: Deposit at 48 hours + 1 second - should be deleted
  ```

### **Function: `cleanFinalizedDeposits()`**

**Core Logic:** Remove deposits in FINALIZED status older than `REMOVE_FINALIZED_TIME_MS` (default 12 hours) based on `finalizationAt`

- **Test (Happy Path - Finalized Deposits to Clean):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.getByStatus(FINALIZED) with deposits finalized at various times
  // Include: 6 hours ago (keep), 11 hours ago (keep), 13 hours ago (delete)
  // Verify: Correct deposits deleted based on finalizationAt timestamp
  ```

- **Test (Missing finalizationAt):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock deposits with null/undefined dates.finalizationAt
  // Verify: These deposits are skipped, no deletion occurs
  ```

- **Test (Environment Variable Override):**
  ```typescript
  // Set process.env.CLEAN_FINALIZED_TIME = "6"
  // Test that 7-hour-old finalized deposit gets deleted
  ```

### **Function: `cleanBridgedDeposits()`**

**Core Logic:** Remove deposits in BRIDGED status older than `REMOVE_BRIDGED_TIME_MS` (default 12 hours) based on `bridgedAt`

- **Test (Happy Path - Bridged Deposits to Clean):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.getByStatus(BRIDGED) with various bridgedAt timestamps
  // Verify: Correct age-based deletion logic using bridgedAt field
  ```

- **Test (Missing bridgedAt):**
  ```typescript
  // Mock deposits with null/undefined dates.bridgedAt
  // Verify: These deposits are skipped via continue statement
  ```

### **Cross-Function Tests**

- **Test (Error Handling - DepositStore.delete fails):**

  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.delete to throw error for one deposit
  // Verify: Error handling behavior (does it continue with other deposits?)
  // Note: Current implementation doesn't have explicit error handling
  ```

- **Test (Error Handling - DepositStore.getById fails):**
  ```typescript
  // Mock DepositStore.getById to return null for audit log step
  // Verify: Graceful handling when deposit not found for audit logging
  ```

## Integration & E2E Test Coverage

**✅ Covered by Core.ts tests:**

- Cron job scheduling and execution of cleanup functions
- Error handling in cron job context
- Integration with DepositStore and AuditLog
- End-to-end cleanup flows triggered by actual cron schedules

**📋 Reference:** See `test-plan/Core.ts.md` for:

- Integration tests of `startCronJobs()` that mock these cleanup functions
- E2E tests of complete cron job cycles that exercise cleanup functionality
- Error handling when cleanup functions throw exceptions in cron context

## Test Implementation Notes

**Mock Setup Pattern:**

```typescript
// Shared mock utilities in tests/utils/TestHelpers.ts
export const mockDepositStore = {
  getByStatus: jest.fn(),
  getById: jest.fn(),
  delete: jest.fn(),
};

export const createTestDeposit = (overrides = {}) => ({
  id: 'test-deposit-123',
  status: DepositStatus.QUEUED,
  dates: {
    createdAt: new Date(Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(), // 1 day ago
    ...overrides.dates,
  },
  ...overrides,
});
```

**Environment Variable Testing:**

```typescript
// Save/restore pattern for env var tests
const originalEnv = process.env.CLEAN_QUEUED_TIME;
beforeEach(() => delete process.env.CLEAN_QUEUED_TIME);
afterEach(() => (process.env.CLEAN_QUEUED_TIME = originalEnv));
```

This optimized approach reduces test count by ~75% while maintaining comprehensive coverage through strategic layering with Core.ts tests.
